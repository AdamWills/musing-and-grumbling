I think (I hope!) I've mentioned that I invested in the [WNBA League Pass](https://leaguepass.wnba.com/) this year. I've been taking advantage of it – to follow [Kia Nurse](https://twitter.com/kaynurse11?lang=en)'s rookie season in particular. But now that that the Liberty's season is over I'm fully immersed in the playoffs. Thursday night's game between the [Phoenix Mercury](http://mercury.wnba.com/) and the [Connecticut Sun](http://sun.wnba.com/)? I mean, come on! This is fantastic basketball.

There's no doubt that Thursday's game was fast-paced. But it wasn't until I sat almost courtside in Westchester County Center that I fully understood how fast, how athletic, how powerful, a WNBA game can be. We had the pleasure of attending the [NY Liberty](http://liberty.wnba.com/)'s final 2018 home game in person, and it was an amazing experience! (even though the Liberty lost...)

If you didn't buy yourself a [League Pass](https://leaguepass.wnba.com/), there's still time. And at this point in the season you get an extra sweet deal. But if you have the chance to attend a playoff game firsthand, please do. And if you're in a position to send some other folks to attend, [as Kent Bazemore has done](https://www.ajc.com/news/local/hawks-bazemore-buys-300-atlanta-dream-playoff-tickets-for-local-youth/FQZZcLyuV9KRFG8TU4hjvI/) (h/t [@LaChina Robinson](https://twitter.com/LaChinaRobinson)), consider that too.

I wish it hadn't taken me this long to realize I love watching basketball. I've missed so much! But I'm trying not to waste a minute now that I do understand.
