Like many of you, sometimes (often) I like to ease myself to sleep with a good podcast. Not so good that it defeats the purpose, of course. If I really want to fall asleep, I'm looking for a particular kind of content and presentation: mildly engaging, measured, soothing.

I’ve given several bedtime podcasts a try - some explicitly made for pre-sleep listening, most not. I have several favourites now, but none of these lulls the right nerves every time. While I pondered what makes for the ideal sleepytime sounds, I decided I'd put my own ideas to the test and give it a try.

By try, I mean I have recorded a little of my own bedtime listening. Not so much listening _for_ me; I’m not sure how I feel about falling asleep to the sound of my own voice. But maybe someone else out there needs to be lulled into a good nap.

So, for those of you who enjoy poetry and Poe, and are ready to doze....

## Poetic Lullabies: Reading Poe
