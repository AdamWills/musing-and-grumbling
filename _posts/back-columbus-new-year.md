Sometimes you just need to mix up your New Year's Eve routine...

## Fun things to do in Columbus, Ohio over the New Year's holiday:

- Get over it. ('it' being your Christmas oranges going in the border guard's garbage because you failed to eat or peel them before leaving Canada)
- Beat the line-up at the Angola Subway.
- Drive through crappy Pennsylvania weather to get there.
- Eat a vegan hotdog with a side of broccoli and a local beer at [Dirty Frank's](http://dirtyfrankscolumbus.com/).
- Play [Centipede](http://my.ign.com/atari/centipede) at [16-Bit Bar+Arcade](http://www.16-bitbar.com/).
- Order the "good" bourbon from room service. (and don't look at the bill)
- Watch the end and then the beginning of _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_.
- Consume the Vegan Club from [Hadley's Bar + Kitchen](http://www.hadleysbar.com/).
- Visit the [Columbus Museum of Art](https://www.columbusmuseum.org/).  Special mentions: the [_Beyond Impressionism_](http://www.columbusmuseum.org/beyond-impressionism/) exhibition, the [Laura Park](http://www.singingbones.com/) comics residency, the Lego model of Columbus, the charming staff, and the toddler who really wanted a hands-on encounter with the massive [Chihuly](https://www.chihuly.com/) piece on the second floor.
- Nap.
- Have the sweet restaurant host find you a table.
- Reach a consensus that Nazis are way worse than nu metal.
- Forget to order the vegan brownie. (okay, maybe not so fun)
- Refuse to believe [Express Live](http://www.promowestlive.com/concert_venues/express-live-columbus-ohio)'s bag policy but work things out with the kind staff.
- Ask the bartender to take a Canadian dollar instead of 50 cents US.
- Find out you're standing beside two other Hamiltonians.

**ROCK OUT to The Obsessed, Devin Townsend Project and Clutch!!!** 

- Snag a cab immediately.
- Forget to check out the Arnold Schwarzenegger statue before leaving town.
- Discover that sometimes winter driving in Ohio weather is as sh\*tty as it is in Pennsylvania.
- Do all of the above with two of the most awesome people.

**_Happy new year!_**

(p.s.: Is there a war on tea in Ohio?)
