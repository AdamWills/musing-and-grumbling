Thanks mostly to DeMar DeRozan (Toronto Raptors) and Kevin Love (Cleveland Cavaliers), I've been thinking a lot about athletes' mental health. I want to say more about [DeRozan](https://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2018/02/25/raptors-derozan-hopes-honest-talk-on-depression-helps-others.html) and [Love'](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kevin-love-everyone-is-going-through-something)s public sharing of their vulnerabilities, about responses to their sharing, and about mental health in the NBA more generally. But before I get there, I want to spend a little time addressing mental health in the world of student athletes.

Earlier this year, when I had the pleasure of speaking with McMaster University's Director of Athletics and Recreation, Glen Grunwald, I learned of an organization focused on the mental wellness of student-athletes in Canada: SAMHI, the Student-Athlete Mental Health Initiative. At the time, Grunwald's reference to SAMHI was one detail in a broader story about the student-athlete experience. But after DeRozan and Love sparked conversations about depression, anxiety and such in the NBA world, I thought again of SAMHI and realized I wanted to learn more.

To that end, I produced another interview segment for CFMU 93.3 FM's _Maurader Morning_ program, this time featuring my conversation with the president and co-founder of SAMHI, the Student-Athlete Mental Health Initiative, Samantha DeLenardo.

DeLenardo was a student-athlete. As a graduate student she studied student-athlete mental health, not just to learn more but also to develop strategies for helping student-athletes who struggle with mental health issues. And that is  why SAMHI exists.

I found my conversation with DeLenardo inspiring. I hope you do too.
