## TVOntario documentaries on YouTube

On the weekend I watched _The Gardener_ and _Buddy_. I also finally started watching the documentary series, [_The Polar Sea_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgBne2KTlDUyU8jBiiMqsun0FNXOCF6CV). I recommend all of them but there are plenty more worth checking out.
