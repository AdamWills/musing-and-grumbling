It is with overwhelming grief that we announce the untimely passing of Dr. Laura Marie Wiebe on Tuesday, August 16th, 2022 with her two sisters by her side at the age of 46 after a battle with cancer.

Laura is survived by her partner of 12 years, Adam Wills; her sisters, Barbara Wiebe Cisecki (Jeff) and Deanna Wiebe (Lazgin Isa); and her nieces, sisters Charlotte Wiebe and Sarah Riley, sisters Brooke and Natasha Cisecki. Laura is predeceased by her parents, Lorne (who passed away in Laura’s arms in May 2019) and Valerie (July 2021) Wiebe.

Cats were a very important part of Laura’s life, so we have to mention that she is predeceased by her first and irreplaceable cat, Jessica, Napalm, Maximiliano, Xavier, Asbestos, Daisy, and “this most lovely and wonderful and the bestest of cats”, Minue (June 2022).

Laura will be missed by many relatives, friends, colleagues and students.

Donations to the following charities that Laura supported would be meaningful:

- [Ladybird Animal Sanctuary, Hamilton, ON](https://www.ladybirdanimalsanctuary.com/)
- [The Donkey Sanctuary of Canada, Puslinch, ON](https://www.thedonkeysanctuary.ca/)
- [Jacobs Ridge Animal Sanctuary, Murcia, Spain](https://www.jacobsridge.com/)

I share the clearly spoken closing remark that Laura said to her students in a lecture she was giving in her sleep 2 nights before she passed, “Always be kind to each other.”
