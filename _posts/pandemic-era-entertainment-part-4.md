## "How Bored Are You?" from Serge Ibaka and the Toronto Raptors

There are numerous episodes online now. You can check them out on the [Raptors Twitter](https://twitter.com/Raptors) feed (and I think their [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/raptors/?hl=en) as well).

Serge Ibaka is far from the only NBA player producing content to entertain us during these trying times, but he's one of my favourites.
