Last year, on October 1, 2017, you would have been able to find me in my front yard, setting up for a full month of Halloween celebrating. This year, I didn't have as much time to prepare for my favourite holiday (sadly). So the decorations went up later, and I relied even more on my listening choices to get me in the right kind of creepy mood and to keep my spooky Hallowday spirits.

In the lead up to Halloween 2017, I binge listened my way through the _No Sleep Podcast_ ([https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com](https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com)) back catalogue. This year, _No Sleep_ remains on my Halloween-friendly playlist, as did _Faculty of Horror_ ([http://www.facultyofhorror.com](http://www.facultyofhorror.com)) and _Lore_ ([https://www.lorepodcast.com](https://www.lorepodcast.com)). Another podcast I listened to (I don't recall which) mentioned _Haunted Places_ ([https://www.parcast.com/haunted](https://www.parcast.com/haunted)) and I binged on this one too. And the reliable _Podcast Playlist_ gave me a few more suggestions in their [well-curated round-up of Halloweenish excerpts](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastplaylist/spooky-podcasts-to-get-you-in-the-halloween-spirit-1.4872857).

I'm open to other suggestions for next year, so feel free to recommend away!
