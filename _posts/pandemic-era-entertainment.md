It's week two of working entirely at home (in the spirit of germ containment), and I don't think I'm any more out of sorts, agitated or discombobulated than usual. But I don't have any particularly useful advice during these weird times either, and I definitely don't have any great insights or wisdom to share.

That said, I am pretty appreciative of the folks and activities that are helping to bring a smile to my face and some normality ( /pleasant abnormality) to my daily life. As a thank you to those folks, and in an effort to share the wealth, I'll try to post some highlights and recommendations here while this weirdness continues.
