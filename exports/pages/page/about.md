_**MUSING and grumbling**_ is created and authored (occasionally) by me: educator, researcher, editor, writer, campus radio host, public speaker and consultant **Laura M. Wiebe**. 

I'm fascinated by and with stories, ideas, music, basketball, science and technology, popular culture and things generally referred to as animals and nature. I value pretty much anything that promotes or contributes to social, environmental, planetary, and interspecies justice. I do not knowingly support anything contrary to these values.

In the blog portion of this site I comment now and then on the topics and issues that interest me. If you want a line on some of my other activities, feel free to check out the links below.

Thanks for dropping by.
