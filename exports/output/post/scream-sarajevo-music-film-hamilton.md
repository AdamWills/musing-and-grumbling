Steeltown (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) has way more cultural events going on than I could ever possibly take advantage of. That abundance includes music and film. As a fan of heavy metal, cinema and history, one upcoming event I am certain not to miss is the November 11th screening of _Scream For Me Sarajevo._

_Scream For Me Sarajevo_ is a documentary about the power of heavy metal in the midst of violent political chaos. The film screens as part of a special night that also features a performance by local metal band PRISMIND and a guest appearance from former Bruce Dickinson drummer Alex Elena.

This documentary is just one of many music-oriented selections included in the [Hamilton Film Festival (HFF)](http://www.hamiltonfilmfestival.com/) schedule. I recently had the chance to speak with HFF's executive director Nathan Fleet – to ask him about the history of Hamilton Film Festival, the fest's independent focus, and its 2017 music-themed programming.

An excerpt from my interview with Nathan Fleet aired during [this week's episode of _Kill Eat Exploit the Weak_](http://cfmu.ca/episodes/5562-kill-eat-exploit-the-weak-episode-for-2017-11-02), and the [same excerpt has been cross-posted to Hellbound.ca](http://hellbound.ca/2017/11/event-preview-scream-sarajevo-prismind-hff-11-nov-2017/). Our full conversation should air on CFMU's _Morning File_ program next week, but in the meantime I want to highlight a few more of the screenings Nathan and I discussed.
